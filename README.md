# Verifiable-Reasoning-Benchmark-Evaluation-Framework
Developed a verifiable reasoning evaluation system that measures AI output quality using semantic similarity and confidence metrics. Supports manual and auto-generated responses via retrieval and LLMs, includes benchmark datasets, score visualization, and analysis tools to study model reliability and failure modes.

🧠 Verifiable Reasoning Benchmark & Evaluation Framework

A research-oriented evaluation system for assessing the factual accuracy, semantic alignment, and reliability of AI-generated answers.
The framework supports both manual inputs and auto-generated responses via LLM + retrieval, enabling structured benchmarking and analysis.

🎯 Objective

Modern LLMs produce fluent outputs but often lack verifiability and grounding.
This project provides a systematic way to:

Quantify answer quality
Detect semantic mismatch and hallucination tendencies
Benchmark performance across different generation strategies

🧩 Core Components
1. Generator (generator.py)
Produces model outputs using OpenAI API
Supports context-aware generation (RAG-style)
2. Retriever (retriever.py)
Lightweight semantic retrieval using embeddings
Selects most relevant context for a given query
3. Evaluation Engine (evaluator.py)
Compares predictions against ground truth
Produces per-sample and aggregate scores
4. Metrics (metrics.py)
Semantic similarity using SentenceTransformers
Cosine similarity for quantitative evaluation
5. UI Layer (app.py)
Built with Streamlit
Interactive dashboard for:
Input
Evaluation

🧪 Example Evaluation Scenarios
High-quality answers
High semantic alignment
Scores close to 1.0
Low-quality answers
Irrelevant / incorrect content
Scores significantly lower
Mixed responses
Partial correctness
Medium-range scores
📊 Evaluation Output
Per-sample scores
Aggregate confidence score
Distribution visualization (histogram)
⚠️ Limitations
Semantic similarity does not guarantee factual correctness
Depends on quality of ground truth
LLM outputs may vary across runs
Retrieval module is simplified (not production-scale)
🚀 Future Work
Multi-model benchmarking (GPT, Claude, open-source models)
Advanced hallucination detection
Citation-level verification
Dataset-driven evaluation pipelines
Leaderboard + experiment tracking
🧠 Research Motivation

This project is inspired by the need for trustworthy AI systems, where outputs are not only fluent but verifiable, grounded, and measurable.
